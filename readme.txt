The benchmark has the following qualities:

1. Round-trip latency, rather than overall throughput
2. A warm up cycle where data is not collected to ensure that any cold-start requirements of the ORBs are satisfied
3. No arguments in the inout parameters or return type as we are testing the raw speed of the ORB
